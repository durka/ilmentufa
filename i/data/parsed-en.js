When the argument of $x_4$ is 1, the generalized eigenspace $x_3$ is simply a strict/simple/basic eigenspace; this is the typical (and probable cultural default) meaning of this word. $x_4$ will typically be restricted to integer values k > 0. $x_2$ should always be specified (at least implicitly by context), for an eigenvalue does not mean much without the linear transformation being known. However, since one usually knows the said linear transformation, and since the basic underlying relationship of this word is 'eigen-ness', the eigenvalue is given the primary terbri ($x_1$). When filling $x_3$ and/or $x_4$, $x_2$ and $x_1$ (in that order of importance) should already be (at least contextually implicitly) specified. $x_3$ is the set of all eigenvectors of linear transformation $x_2$, endowed with all of the typical operations of the vector space at hand. The default includes the zero vector (else the $x_3$ eigenspace is not actually a vector space); normally in the context of mathematics, the zero vector is not considered to be an eigenvector, but by this definition it is included. Thus, a Lojban mathematician would consider the zero vector to be an (automatic) eigenvector of the given (in fact, any) linear transformation (particularly ones represented by a square matrix in a given basis). This is the logically most basic definition, but is contrary to typical mathematical culture. This word implies neither nondegeneracy nor degeneracy of eigenspace $x_3$. In other words there may or may not be more than one linearly independent vector in the eigenspace $x_3$ for a given eigenvalue $x_1$ of linear transformation $x_2$. $x_3$ is the unique generalized eigenspace of $x_2$ for given values of $x_1$ and $x_4$. $x_1$ is not necessarily the unique eigenvalue of linear transformation $x_2$, nor is its multiplicity necessarily 1 for the same. Beware when converting the terbri structure of this word. In fact, the set of all eigenvalues for a given linear transformation $x_2$ will include scalar zero (0); therefore, any linear transformation with a nontrivial set of eigenvalues will have at least two eigenvalues that may fill in terbri $x_1$ of this word. The 'eigenvalue' of zero for a proper/nice linear transformation will produce an 'eigenspace' that is equivalent to the entire vector space at hand. If $x_3$ is specified by a set of vectors, the span of that set should fully yield the entire eigenspace of the linear transformation $x_2$ associated with eigenvalue $x_1$, however the set may be redundant (linearly dependent); the zero vector is automatically included in any vector space. A multidimensional eigenspace (that is to say a vector space of eigenvectors with dimension strictly greater than 1) for fixed eigenvalue and linear transformation (and generalization exponent) is degenerate by definition. The algebraic multiplicity $x_5$ of the eigenvalue does not entail degeneracy (of eigenspace) if greater than 1; it is the integer number of occurrences of a given eigenvalue $x_1$ in the multiset of eigenvalues (spectrum) of the given linear transformation/square matrix $x_2$. In other words, the characteristic polynomial can be factored into linear polynomial primes (with root $x_1$) which are exponentiated to the power $x_5$ (the multiplicity; notably, not $x_4$). For $x_4$ > $x_5$, the eigenspace is trivial. $x_2$ may not be diagonalizable. The scalar zero (0) is a naturally permissible argument of $x_1$ (unlike some cultural mathematical definitions in English). Eigenspaces retain the operations and properties endowing the vectorspaces to which they belong (as subspaces). Thus, an eigenspace is more than a set of objects: it is a set of vectors such that that set is endowed with vectorspace operators and properties. Thus {klesi} alone is insufficient. But the set underlying eigenspace $x_3$ is a type of {klesi}, with the property of being closed under linear transformation $x_2$ (up to scalar multiplication). The vector space and basis being used are not specified by this word. Use this word as a seltau in constructions such as 'eigenket', 'eigenstate', etc. (In such cases, {te} {aigne} is recommended for the typical English usages of such terms. Use {zei} in lujvo formed by these constructs. The term 'eigenvector' may be rendered as {cmima} {be} {le} {te} {aigne}).

The ith term in tuple X2 is replaced with the ith term in tuple X3; the replacements are executed simultaneously (thus, no overlap/contradiction can be allowed to arise in the substitution- in particular, in X2)  - alternatively, if there is overlap/conflict in/between the terms of X2, the replacements are performed in order of presentation (the ith term in X2 is replaced by the ith term in X3, and then the (i+1)th term in X2 is replaced with the (i+1)th term in X3, starting with the 1st term in each). X2 and X3 must have the same length/number of terms - alternatively, X3 cannot be longer/have more terms than X2; in this situation, the ith term of X2 is replaced with the ith term of X3 until and including when the last term of X3 is reached, after which point the remaining terms in X2 are not replaced at all. Use a permutation acting on X2 as the argument for X3 in order to rearrange the substrings of X1; if the alphabet is ordered, then operators can be applied to the letters in order to rotate through the alphabet. In particular, if X1 is a binary string (a word over an alphabet of two letters) and X2 is the 2-tuple of the letters of that binary alphabet (length-1 substrings), then without specification of X3, this operator defaults to bitwise binary negation (bit conjugation) wherein each letter in X1 is replaced by the unique other letter in the binary alphabet (otherwise, the replacement would be the identity/trivial replacement or just a formal substitution letter-by-letter which does not really change the nature of the word). X1 and each entry in X2 and X3 should be quoted, match a necessary type (such as being a character), or be abstracted a level by symbolics. In general, the replacement is formal and the strings in X3 need not be over the same alphabet as the one over which X1 is written. This operator is useful for combinatorial lines and for expanding digits (such as, in a binary string, replacing each occurrence of '0' with '01' and each occurrence of '1' with '10'; note that the replacement is instantaneous and simultaneous for all terms of X2 and every occurrence of such terms in X1, thus this substitution is perfectly acceptable)."},"bainri":{"word":"bainri","type":"fu'ivla","definition":"$x_1$ is an executable/binary file to be run in system/runtime environment $x_2$.","notes":"A calque on the English word 'binary'.

Thus, the indices/labels specified are included in the range of sampling; id est: if the matrix entries listed belong to the ith row and jth column and the (i+n)th row and (j+m)th column respectively (for positive integers i,j,n,m), then the sampling will be conducted in all rows of number between (and including) i and i+n (yielding n+1 sampled rows) and in all columns of number between (and including) j and j+m (yielding m+1 sampled columns). The default diagonal sampling procedure for x4 is as follows: The first sampled entry has the minimum allowed (as specified in x3) indices.  All latter sampled entries (by default) have indices of the immediately previous sampled entry each augmented by 1. (Which is to say that if the kth sampled entry has indices (x,y,...), in that order, then the (k+1)th sampled entry has indices (x+1,y+1,...), in that order and where each subsequent index would be the respective index of the kth sampled entry augmented by 1).  The process terminates generally whenever exactly one entry is sampled from each of the rows, each of the columns, etc. of the tensor.  In the default, the process terminates when at least one of the indices of a sampled entry of the tensor is as large as possible in the range specified by x3. Thus, in order to reconcile the general and the default termination conditions, the range specified by x3 must be compatible with both; id est: it must be a r-dimensional hypercube of entries, so to speak, where r is the rank of tensor x2. The default for sampling range x3 is between and including the entry in the first row and first column (etc.) and the entry in the last row and last column (etc.) for an r-dimensional hypercube tensor (meaning that each row, column, etc. of the tensor has exactly the same number of entries as the others).  Generally, the default range begins with the entry of indices each minimal in the tensor (called 'the first entry') and extends to include ('draw') the maximal r-dimensional hypercube of entries in the tensor with one vertex on the first entry; in other words, if the minimum of the set of maximal indices in the tensor is g, then the sampling range is every row between the first and the gth, every column between the first and the gth, etc.  Generally, the sampling range must be an r-dimensional orthotope of some positive size (that is to say: including at least one entry) no larger than the tensor itself, but with the freedom to place at most r of its vertices among the entries thereof; if the default sampling procedure x4 is being used, then the r-dimensional orthotope must be an r-dimensional hypercube. Generalizes to any tensor, but is only interesting for tensors of rank at least 1. Any mention of geometric terminology (such as mention of diagonals, orthotopes, etc.) in the definition or notes of this word should be interpreted cautiously and is not necessarily good Lojbanic practice; such terminology should not necessarily be emulated in practicing Lojbanic thought or speech. Not for use for geometric diagonals (such as between vertices); confer: {digno}."},"dai'i":{"word":"dai'i","type":"experimental cmavo","definition":"attitudinal modifier: supposed emotion - factual emotion","notes":"Used for emotions that are non-factual, for example when talking about hypothetical events. la'a ui dai'i mi ba te dunda lo karce lo mi patfu I will probably be given a car by my dad and I would feel happy about it if that happened."},"da'inai":{"word":"da'inai","type":"cmavo-compound","definition":"discursive: supposing - in fact."},"dai'o":{"word":"dai'o","type":"experimental cmavo","definition":"discursive & gafyzmico: reset/restore all defaults (permanently) to discourse-exterior specification; cancel all following discourse-interior default assignments","notes":"Any modification made to the default value of all terbri is hereby cancelled and the definitions of all words (with respect to default specifications for terbri), as they explicitly appear in official Lojban word lists and other resources, is hereby used.

The immediately following (next) unfilled terbri at that level of nesting is affected by this word; if no such terbri exists at that level of nesting, this word's affects apply to the next unfilled terbri in the immediately higher level of nesting (unnested once); if no unfilled terbri exist at any/all levels of nesting and following the immediately previous sumti (even if unfilled terbri exist prior to that sumti), this word has no meaningful affect and can be ignored.  This word must be followed by a sumti; for the purpose of this explanation, this sumti will be xy (as in 'de'ai xy').  The affected terbri is defined to default to the value xy (the sumti as a whole, including gadri, tanru, relative clauses, etc.); in other words, when not explicitly filled or when filled be {di'au}, the sumti value filling the affected terbri is that of xy.  This affect remains in effect until the end of the text/conversation or until/unless the default setting of this terbri explicitly redefined (overriding by {di'ei} is temporary/only applies to that usage). If xy is {zo'e}, the default value is completely general and elliptical; thus, permanently overriding a default setting on a specific terbri may be done by 'de'ai zo'e'. The scope of this word fully encompasses and ends with the following sumti (xy); thus, the second sumti, same-/higher-level terminator, a FA cmavo, etc. following this word ends the new default specification in addition to its other functions.  Additionally, this word does not actually fill the affected terbri with any particular sumti/value; it merely defines its default value hereinafter. CAUTION: Thus, the second same-level sumti uttered actually fills the affected terbri; in order to access the newly-defined default value of the terbri immediately after definition, follow 'xy' (with terminator) immediately with implicit (or possibly explicit) '{zo'e}' (possibly necessitating terminators), '{di'au}', or 'xy' itself. Moreover, therefore, the default value defined by this word does not immediately/necessarily affect the truth value of the statement in which it appears (it only does so if the second following sumti is not {di'au}, implicit (or possibly) explicit {zo'e}, or xy itself); however, in all future uses of the brivla to which the terbri belongs, unless explicitly filled with a sumti of a different value, the truth value of those statements will be affected.  Also, {su} does not erase this new definition of default. If the affected terbri is naturally defined to have a default or if it has no naturally defined default value, this word semi-permanently over-writes them.

The number of polytope 'tiles' used can be specified in the third of fifth terbri as desired; the polytopes used need not all be the same, nor regular, so long as the arrangement is meaningful and possible. One of the main differences between rectangular polyplets and polyominoes is that polyominoes cannot have their polytope tiles touching only at their vertices whereas polyplets can (thus, polyominoes are a subset of the rectangular polyplets); this difference can be specified in the final terbri. A tiling of a space may be considered to be an infinite polyform, but that is rather pathological and we can reasonably assume that polyforms referenced by this word will be finite. The polyform is considered to be a unified whole entity. The ambient space is usually going to be the Euclidean space of the same dimension as the polytopes (and the former dimension cannot be exceeded by the latter except in the marginal case of lower-dimensional (id est: hyperplanar) arrangements, in which case parallel cross-sections are really being considered); this space determines the rigid-motion/symmetry isomorphisms of various polyforms (Z and S tetraminoes are non-isomorphic under rigid-motion in the Euclidean plane but are so isomorphic in Euclidean 3-space). The ambient space also determines the expression of (and indeed the 'allowed') polytopes: spherical geometry allows for digons to be arranged so as to form a polyform, but Euclidean 2-space prohibits such objects from the set of possible polygons. The default polytope will probably be a 2-dimensional square; thus the default ambient space will likely be Euclidean 2-space.

(notably, 'Did B come to Ralph from C?' is not a possible option for answering the question). An answer is a SE string that is allowed by the selbri and by the subscripts; continuing the example, if the response is 'Ralph went to C from B', one would respond with '.i {setese}'.  Any SE word works for the general question possibility (which is the unrestricted/non-subscripted case). Essentially 'se'u'o xi sy' is equivalent to 'se xi li xo poi ke'a cmima sy' (where '{te}' is basically understood as ' se xi li jo'i pa boi ci te'u ', etc.), but the answer can be a complicated ordered sequence/string of SE words; this word complements specifically {fi'a} in the typical/same way that SE complements FA. Typically, leaving the subscripted set vague or not completely free of every possible semantic or syntactic pathology is perfectly fine; syntax and practicality will typically restrict it enough for reasonable responses to be made.

This color is a subset/element (depending on interpretation/usage) of the colors associated with light in the radio and microwave regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. Speaker determines how close 'approximately twenty-one centimeters' is to exactly twenty-one centimeters. Technically can only be used for the coloration of light that would arise from the hyperfine spin-flip transition of a hydrogen atom (without any neutrons) in which the proton-electron quantum spin configuration abruptly changes from parallel to antiparallel in the 1s groundstate.  But other isotopes and/or hydrogenic (id est: single-electron) atoms can be referenced by semantic broadening; note that in any case, this word always refers to the color of the light emitted from such an object. This is a color, not a description of the process, conditions under which the light of this color is emitted, etc., nor is it the light itself nor wavelength of the light.  However, this term probably will come up in all such descriptions.  For example, 'hyperfine spin-flip transition' might be rendered {xipfne binxo}. Technically, any object that emits photons with wavelengths of approximately twenty-one centimeters will be of the color xipfne, regardless of why such emission is occurring (id est: it need not be due to hydrogen hyperfine, proton/electron spin-flip transitions).  Usage in such a case is perfectly acceptable.  However, in practice, such occasions/contexts will be rare (essentially completely absent except in theory) and the only common usage will be in the context of hydrogen hyperfine proton/electron spin-flip transitions (as in astronomy, chemistry, or quantum mechanics). This is an electromagnetic (id est: light, photon) color.
